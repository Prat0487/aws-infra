# aws-infra

## Purpose

This repository contains the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for our AWS-based cloud infrastructure. It defines and manages our AWS resources using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.

## Overview

The `aws-infra` repository is designed to:
- Maintain a consistent and reproducible AWS infrastructure
- Enable version control for infrastructure changes
- Facilitate collaboration among team members
- Automate the provisioning and management of AWS resources

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/aws-infra.git
   

2. Install the required tools:
   - AWS CLI
   - Terraform (or the IaC tool used in this project)
   - Any other project-specific dependencies

3. Set up your AWS credentials:
   
   aws configure
   

4. Review the project structure and documentation in each directory

## Project Structure

- `/modules`: Reusable infrastructure components
- `/environments`: Environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts for infrastructure management
- `/docs`: Additional documentation

## How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes and test them locally
3. Submit a pull request for review
4. After approval, merge your changes into the main branch

## Best Practices

- Always use version control for infrastructure changes
- Test changes in a non-production environment first
- Use consistent naming conventions for resources
- Document any significant changes or design decisions

## Security

- Never commit AWS credentials or sensitive information to the repository
- Use AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access
- Encrypt sensitive data using AWS KMS or other secure methods

## Additional Resources

- [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/) (if using Terraform)
- [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
